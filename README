To start python backend: 

- requires git bash terminal
- python 3.12 +

1. execute the script `start-backend.sh`. this will create an environment and install the dependencies you need to run the backend.
2. now, cancel that process, and execute this line
`.venv/Scripts/python backend/backend-server.py`. This will start the python/flask backend (which isn't fully connected).

3. to start the frontend, navigate to the 'frontend' directory and run `npm install --force`

4. now run `npm run dev` to start the frontend.

5. you will not yet be able to access the frontend - first you need to hook a Mysql database up to your frontend by providing sql db login credentials in an .env file in the 'frontend' directory like so: 

`DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:password@localhost:3306/parker"`

6. now ensure your MySQL database is up and running and voila! you're good to go.
